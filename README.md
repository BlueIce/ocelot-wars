## Building ocelot-wars

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ocelot-wars/ocelot-wars.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ocelot-wars/ocelot-wars)


We use Gradle as the build system with the Gradle Wrapper. To build the project either use
```
./gradlew
```
on Linux/Mac or
```
gradlew.bat
```
on Windows appending the desired command like `test` to the call.

## Formatting settings

We use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) for the basic formatting settings. There are [plugins available](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for most IDEs and editors.
